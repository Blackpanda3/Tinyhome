                We will work through final details and send a purchase agreement out to you via DocuSign. Once it has 
                been signed and the 50% deposit has been completed, we will have an in-house meeting about your build 
                followed by an e-intro email connecting you directly to our interior designer or architect if floor plan 
                changes are necessary.

                You will spend 1 to 2 weeks working with our interior designer to make sure that your THV 
                tiny house has the exact look and feel you prefer.  If you have a custom floor plan, our 
                design team will spend approximately 8 weeks helping you dream up your design.  Once you have 
                signed off on the floor plan and design descriptions, we move to the next phase.

                Usually, by the time you are finished working with our design team, your trailer and windows have 
                been delivered to our shop.  We then meet up with our build team and have a meeting with them 
                about your build, showing them your designs and vision.  If we aren’t on a long backlog, we will 
                begin framing that week!

                RVIA-certified seal of approval.  The final payment is due upon completion but before delivery.  
                 The current wait time for a  Tiny Home Vision tiny home is approximately 1-3 months. <!--primarily due to 
                significant demand for our tiny homes, as well as the well-publicized issues in the supply chain. -->
