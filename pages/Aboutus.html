        <h4> THE STORY </h4>
        <div class="story-text">
            <p>
                A long, long, time ago, a couple of friends dreamt of a unique vision for their 
                lives.  After meeting one another at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, 
                they decided they wanted to live life differently.  They demanded freedom, adventure,
                 exploration, sunsets, travel, and flexibility. After being introduced to the tiny 
                 home movement years ago, it was clear to them: the path to big freedom was to go 
                 tiny!  And so began the quest to learn more about the tiny home movement.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, information on how exactly to "go tiny" wasn't so readily available, 
                and answers to questions about design, best types of builds, livability, safety
                 and legality were vague (or completely undefined). Not only was building a tiny 
                 home a challenging endeavor, but understanding regulations, safety, 
                 roadworthiness, and zoning was a challenge in and of itself!   We saw too many 
                 stories of expensive tiny homes on wheels that weren't even mobile (too heavy), 
                 homes that fell apart (poor design/cheap trailer), or homes that didn't even 
                 consider things like snow load (it can absolutely crush your roof).  
                 How frustrating it must be for someone to finally make the decision to "go tiny"
                  and have it all fall apart!
            </p>

            <p>
                It was then, over margaritas and tacos, that this group of friends decided they would build 
                the best tiny house construction company the world had ever seen. We wanted to build 
                beautiful homes, homes that would rival or eclipse the quality and craftsmanship of your 
                standard 3000 square ft. home.   We wanted to build homes robust enough to stand the test 
                of time - something that could be handed down to your kids. And their kids. We wanted to 
                build beautiful homes that were roadworthy and that could be towed hundreds of thousands 
                of miles without a hiccup.  So that's what we did.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fast forward a few years, the "guys" are a much bigger team as it stands today.  
                Along with adding several new friends, including tiny house experts, architects, 
                and interior designers to the team, they also added a few wives/husbands, a slew of
                 kids, and a dozen dogs. As our teams and families have expanded, so too has our 
                 scale, and this newer, bigger team builds our spectacular tiny homes hand in hand
                  with Amish craftsmen in Northern Ohio.  Renowned for their carpentry, we knew the
                   path to the best possible tiny homes was to partner and work hand-in-hand with
                    the greatest craftsmen in the world.  Thankfully, they are right here in Ohio.
            </p>

            <p>
                ​Our growth wasn't without its challenges.  We've made a lot of mistakes through our 
                growth.  We've learned a lot of things the hard way.  Just because someone is 
                passionate about something doesn't mean they can build a good business around it.  
                There were dozen times we could have failed and closed up shop, but we persisted long 
                enough, and here we are today.  
                 Where we struggled to sell one home early on, we've already built over one dozen in 
                 the first quarter of 2018.  We are so blessed, and we owe it to all of our families, 
                 friends, the tiny house movement, and especially our early customers for keeping us 
                 afloat.  Thank you all for sticking with us and following our journey.  To our early
                  customers:  thank you so, so much for giving us a chance.  You're helping us live 
                  our dreams, too.
            </p>
